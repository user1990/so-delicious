Copy your MongoDB URI to variables.env configuration file located in root.

Change ```dbuser``` and ```dbpassword``` with yours from mLab.

Download MongoDB Compass - For interact/analize your data collections with full CRUD functionality.
### Send Email

For sending email with Nodejs use Mailtrap.io — Fake smtp testing server.

Go [here](https://mailtrap.io/) and Sign Up.

In variables.env put your MAIL_USER & MAIL_PASS from mailtrap.io account.
### Google Maps

Get API key from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

Put the key in MAP_KEY const in variables.env file.

Or use existing one if it's not expired yet.

### Sample Data

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

## FAQ

### The Google Maps API key isn't working

The project might have hit a limit with the API key — if this is the case you need to sign up for your own API key over at <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage>. You will need to enable static maps for your API key.

Once you have the API key, simply place it in your `variables.env` file and restart.

### I'm getting errors related to `/data/db` like `code:100` and `connection failed`

## I'm getting a `URIError: URI malformed` error when running `npm start`

Thanks to [Chris Ellinger](https://twitter.com/devoidofgenius) for this:

> If you’re getting a `URIError: URI malformed` error when running `npm start`, break out your environment variables. Go into `variables.env` and split the URI like this `MONGO_URI=mongodb://host.com:port` `DB_USER=username` and `DB_PASS=password`. Then inside your `start.js` replace `mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE)` with `mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {user: process.env.DB_USER, pass: process.env.DB_PASS});`. I had issues connecting to my mongodb because my password contained symbols.
